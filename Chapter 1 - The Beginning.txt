"It is the 22nd of April in the year 2612.
The spaceship called B-22 once again got a mission: to explore the planet PT-614.
Based on the planet's analysis, its atmosphere is the same as Earth's.
Therefore, people can survive there without armor or a spacesuit.
We are already very near it, so in 3-5 hours we can..."

There was a metal knock on the door...

- Are you sleeping, slacker? 
- Oh shit, it's Max again, - whispered Karl.
- What are you whispering there? Let's go out! It's breakfast time already.
- I'm already leaving! - shouted Karl.

He really pisses me off... I think one day I'll just kill him.
Well, it's really time to eat.
I left my bedroom and headed towards the dining room.
At almost at the same time, the girl Kate also left her bedroom.
We exchanged glances and went to the dining room together.

- By the way, Karl! - shouted Kate.
- What?
- Did you know that the planet where we're flying has a lot of oil?
- Really?
- Moreover, we can even get diesel from it!
- I hope the local bugs won't meet us with tanks and flamethrowers, lol.
- They are not that smart, but they also have something resembling a collective mind.
- Collective mind... Fuck, I don't want to live on the planet of communists!
- You'll have to.

Me and Kate are already in the dining room.
It's 8:00. The whole crew must have dinner now. 
By the way, meet the team!

My name is Karl and I the main character and communications manager.
Kate is the only girl on the spaceship and serves as the scientific officer.
Max is the captain who always keeps everything under control.
John is the pilot of the spaceship, known for his exceptional flying skills.
Peter is the engineer who often works outside the ship, fixing various issues.

- Hi guys! - Karl said.
- Oh, Karl and Kate. Glad to see you. - Max shouted.
- Likewise. - Karl and Kate replied in unison.
- Do you all know that we have less than 3 hours before arriving on the planet PT-614? - Max said.
- Well, sort of. - the team replied.
- Good. John, you must land the ship near the water after breakfast time.
- Ok. - John said.
- Peter, check all systems again. Karl and Kate, you must send the analyzed data about the planet 
  to management. What about me? I'll make a plan for the next month. Bon appetit, everyone!
- Likewise, boss! - the team replied.

After adjusting his favorite blue cap snugly on his head, Max left.
Looking out the window, I noticed something.
There was a fast-moving blue comet.
The spaceship's alarms activated.
The comet will hit us in 20 seconds.
The autopilot couldn't do anything, and John ran to the cockpit.
Although the ship managed to dodge, some were parts were hit.
The ship lost control and headed to the planet. 
In a few minutes, the ship crashed, miraculously avoiding burning up in the atmosphere.
Having fallen into the river and slid right along it, the ship finally stopped.
