After the first encounter with the monster, Karl began to call them "bitters", because the first one bit 
his leg.
Karl planned to spend the entire night sorting his supplies.

- Well... And how can I get any light here? - in Karl's thoughts.

Karl decided to try to break down the blocked door in the generator room.
On the way, he took all the tools he could find.
Of course, his "tools" were broken pipes and various pieces of debris.
When he arrived, he saw an interesting sight: there was no door to the generator room at all.

- What the... I couldn't sworn the door was blocked by debris... though this is even better, lol.

Looking around the room, he found a big battery that was quite enough to light some rooms.

- Now, I need to find some lamps and a cable.

In another part of the room, there were some boxes marked "Fragile", and Karl went over to them.
Since childhood Karl had a useful habit: to keep a universal tool in the pocket, which includes a knife, 
flint, and even a screwdriver.
Therefore, opening the sealed boxes wasn't a problem for him.

- Yee! There are some lamps here. - rejoiced Karl.

Under the boxes, there was one big black box.
After opening it, Karl noticed several different cables.

- It's time to run the cables around the ship.
- Wait! Is the battery charged at all?

After fiddling around with cable, Karl lit his first lamp.

- Thank God it's charged.

For the remainder of the night, Karl worked hard to light some important rooms.
He also found some batteries and generators, but now he can't check them out.
In the morning, Karl had almost no strength and went back to sleep.
